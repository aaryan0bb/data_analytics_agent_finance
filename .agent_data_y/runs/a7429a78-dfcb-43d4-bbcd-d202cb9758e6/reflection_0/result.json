  "explanation": "This script computed month-over-month CPI changes and 24-month rolling betas of each stock vs CPI for the last 4 years. Each month stocks were rank-ordered by their rolling beta; the bottom k (low-beta) were equally long with total long exposure = 0.5, and the top k (high-beta) equally short with total short exposure = -0.5. Positions are rebalanced monthly with a 1-month trade delay (no look-ahead). Realistic frictions are included: commission=1bp and slippage=5bp applied to turnover. Position limits and leverage caps are enforced (gross exposure = 1.0, per-asset abs cap = 0.5). Bootstrapped Sharpe (n=2000) produced a 95% CI; Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio (PSR), hit rate, skew, kurtosis, HHI, turnover, and max drawdown are reported. All tabular outputs are saved under DATA_DIR and interactive plots saved as standalone HTML files there."
